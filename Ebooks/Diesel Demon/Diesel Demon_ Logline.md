# "Diesel Demon"

* **Logline:** A possessed trucker, cursed by a demonic entity after a fatal weigh-station ritual, enslaves a fiery runaway in his cab, where their infernal lust summons hellish visions and apocalyptic road rages.  
* **Protagonist Archetypes:**  
  * **The Hero (Luther "Hellfire" Kane):** A 47-year-old owner-operator, infused with a demon from a truck-stop occult deal gone wrong. He's raw and blasphemous, bellowing profanities as the entity amplifies his carnal urges.  
  * **The Heroine (Seraphina):** A 22-year-old occult enthusiast fleeing a cult, whose innocence masks a voracious appetite for possession-play. She's unapologetically shocking, invoking rituals during sex.  
* **Plot & Encounters:** The demon feeds on their encounters, which are graphically supernatural—Luther's eyes glowing as he possesses Seraphina in levitating cab orgies, her summoning tentacles from exhaust fumes for penetration, or a demonic gang ritual at a burning rest stop with hallucinatory imps. Unfiltered curses invoke road demons like "broker bastards from hell," building to world-ending hauls.  
* **Thematic Resonance:** This unfiltered plunge into supernatural isolation shocks with otherworldly taboos, providing truckers a raw escape where autonomy battles infernal control.  
* **Unforeseen Twist:** In the apocalyptic climax, Seraphina unveils herself as the demon's true host, having transferred it to Luther via their first encounter—recasting him as the unwitting slave, with all "possessions" revealed as her projections, and the "runaway" story a lure to harvest his soul for her eternal youth.
