L# **Diesel Demon**

## **Chapter One – Blacktop Baptism**

**Narration:**

The highway stretched black and endless, a scar carved across America’s back. Luther Kane’s eighteen-wheeler thundered down it, coughing diesel like a tired dragon. The dashboard rattled with every mile, coffee cups clinked, and the CB radio spat static curses from faceless truckers. Luther didn’t care. He was forty-seven years old, built like a battered bull, and all he knew was

the road, the haul, and the hate.

**Luther (thought):**

“Another night, another load. Same shit, different highway. Brokers lining their pockets while I rot behind the wheel.”

**Narration:**

His knuckles gripped the wheel, leather calloused, tattoos fading under sweat. A neon-green glow cut through the night ahead. Signs rose from the dark, humming with electric judgment.

**Narration:**

**WEIGH STATION – ALL TRUCKS MUST ENTER.**

**Luther (spoken):**

“Ah, fuck me sideways. Scales again. Goddamn DOT clipboard-cock suckers never sleep.”

**Narration:**

The rig roared onto the ramp, brakes squealing as the tires hit concrete. Fluorescent lights buzzed overhead like a swarm of flies. A squat booth squatted on the lot, glass smeared, shadows moving behind it.

**Luther (thought):**

“Bet it’s some skinny prick in there. Smiling, weighing my life in pounds and ounces. Watching my ass sink while he strokes his pencil-dick power trip.”

**Narration:**

But this weigh station wasn’t normal. Not tonight. Behind the booth, something burned—a pit, carved into the asphalt. Blue diesel fire licked upward, hungry and unnatural. The air reeked of scorched meat.

**Narration:**

The weighmaster leaned out of his booth. His face was a pale smear, eyes hollow like unlit bulbs. He dragged a black sack out beside him, heavy, wet.

**Narration:**

With casual strength, he dumped the contents into the pit. Roadkill. A lump of fur and bone, splitting open on the flames. The smell of burning flesh filled the night.
**Luther (spoken):**

“The fuck is this? You grilling possums out here, or what?”

**Luther (thought):**

“Oh, Jesus Christ—what kind of sick freak throws that into a fire? Guy looks like he’d fuck a goat and brag about it.”

**Narration:**

The flames hissed and roared. Then they leaned. Not upward. Not wild. But inward—toward Luther’s rig. His headlights dimmed. His windshield shimmered as if something invisible pressed against it.

**Narration:**

Symbols, black as oil, crawled across the glass, burning into the surface. Circles within circles, jagged hooks, twisting lines that writhed like snakes.

**Narration:**

And then, a voice.

**Other Voice (demon, whispering):**

“Luuuther Kane…”

**Luther (thought):**

“What the—no. No. Get out of my head. This ain’t real. This ain’t—”

**Narration:**

The dash lights flickered. Needles spun wildly—speedometer climbing to one-fifty, fuel gauge twitching empty, then full, then empty again. The whole rig shuddered like it had a heartbeat.

**Other Voice (demon, doubled, guttural):**

“You are chosen. You will burn the road.”

**Luther (spoken):**

“Fuck you\! You hear me? You diesel-sucking son of a bitch, fuck you\!”

**Narration:**

The wheel vibrated under his grip, metal hot as a brand. The flames outside flared bright enough to sear his retinas. The pit screamed.

**Narration:**

And Luther Kane screamed back, as the possession began.
